Objective:
To develop a Hibernate application that performs CRUD operations on a Student entity stored in a MySQL database using Hibernate ORM.

Explanation:
This task introduces Object Relational Mapping using Hibernate:

Define a Student class annotated with Hibernate/JPA annotations (@Entity, @Id, @Column).

Configure Hibernate using a hibernate.cfg.xml file or Java-based config.

Create operations:

Create: Add a new student.
Read: Fetch and display student(s).
Update: Modify student details.
Delete: Remove a student by ID.
Use SessionFactory and Session from Hibernate to manage database interactions.

This helps you understand:

Hibernate mapping and configuration.
Managing entities and sessions.
Performing database operations using Hibernate.
